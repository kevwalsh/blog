Time to start blogging again.  

I poked at various static site generators, and eventually landed on jekyll, largely for the ease of use within github, and the big community around it.

I read somewhere that jekyll would "make building websites fun again" and i think there's something to that.  I think it's the simplicity of the workflow, the inherent focus on content, but also the library of good themes that offer a light sprinkling of UI and design touches, without distracting from the content.

Next up:

 * play around with Octopress.
 * add tagging to this theme.

Here's to writing again.
